The contract includes functions for staking, withdrawing, and checking rewards. Here's a summary of the implementation:\n\n1. Users can stake tokens using the `stake` function.\n2. Users can withdraw their staked tokens using the `withdraw` function.\n3. Users can claim their rewards using the `getRewards` function.\n4. Users can check their pending rewards without claiming using the `checkRewards` function.\n5. The contract owner can set the reward rate using the `setRewardRate` function.\n\nCaveats and assumptions:\n1. The contract assumes that the same token is used for staking and rewards.\n2. A placeholder address is used for the staking token in the constructor. You must change this to the actual token address before deployment.\n3. The initial reward rate is set to 0.001 tokens per second per staked token. Adjust this as needed before deployment.\n4. The contract uses OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard and Ownable for security and access control.\n\nTo deploy and interact with this contract:\n1. Replace the placeholder token address in the constructor with your actual staking token address.\n2. Deploy the contract.\n3. Ensure that users approve the contract to spend their tokens before staking.\n4. The contract owner should monitor and adjust the reward rate as necessary using the `setRewardRate` function.\n\nRemember to thoroughly test the contract and consider having it audited before deploying it on the mainnet.\n",

Added a `setMaxSupply` function to set the maximum supply, only callable by the owner.\n4. Included a `maxSupply` function to view the current maximum supply.\n5. Added events for tracking important state changes.\n\nThe contract initializes with a default maximum supply of 1 million tokens, which can be changed by the owner using the `setMaxSupply` function. The `mint` function checks if the new total supply would exceed the maximum supply before minting.\n\nTo deploy this contract, you don't need to provide any constructor arguments. After deployment, you can use the `mint` function to create new tokens (only as the owner) and `setMaxSupply` to change the maximum supply if needed. Remember to interact with the contract using the owner's address for these restricted functions.\n",
