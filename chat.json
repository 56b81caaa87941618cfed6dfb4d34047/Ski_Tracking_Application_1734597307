The contract includes functions for staking, withdrawing, and checking rewards. Here's a summary of the implementation:\n\n1. Users can stake tokens using the `stake` function.\n2. Users can withdraw their staked tokens using the `withdraw` function.\n3. Users can claim their rewards using the `getRewards` function.\n4. Users can check their pending rewards without claiming using the `checkRewards` function.\n5. The contract owner can set the reward rate using the `setRewardRate` function.\n\nCaveats and assumptions:\n1. The contract assumes that the same token is used for staking and rewards.\n2. A placeholder address is used for the staking token in the constructor. You must change this to the actual token address before deployment.\n3. The initial reward rate is set to 0.001 tokens per second per staked token. Adjust this as needed before deployment.\n4. The contract uses OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard and Ownable for security and access control.\n\nTo deploy and interact with this contract:\n1. Replace the placeholder token address in the constructor with your actual staking token address.\n2. Deploy the contract.\n3. Ensure that users approve the contract to spend their tokens before staking.\n4. The contract owner should monitor and adjust the reward rate as necessary using the `setRewardRate` function.\n\nRemember to thoroughly test the contract and consider having it audited before deploying it on the mainnet.\n",
